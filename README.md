- Reviewing complex scenarios that require both empathy and objectivity
- Situations requiring balanced assessment of subjective and objective criteria
- Performance reviews that need both self-reflection and external evaluation
- Creative processes that benefit from iterative refinement

## Parameters

### Required Parameters

- `content` (string): Current analysis content from the specified role perspective
- `role` (string): Perspective role, options:
  - `"actor"`: Actor perspective (empathetic/creative viewpoint)
  - `"critic"`: Critic perspective (analytical/evaluative viewpoint)
- `nextRoundNeeded` (boolean): Whether another round of actor-critic dialogue is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number in the sequence (minimum: 1)
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Total number of thoughts planned (must be odd and >= 3)

### Role Perspective Guidelines

**Actor perspective should include:**
- Understanding intentions, creative choices, emotional context, challenges faced
- Self-reflection on performance and decision-making process
- Explanation of creative vision and goals

**Critic perspective should include:**
- Technical execution analysis, effectiveness evaluation
- Audience impact assessment, comparative analysis
- Objective feedback and improvement suggestions

## How to use

- build firstly with `npm install && npm run build`

- config this mcp in your mcp client such as Claude Code

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "critical-thinking": { 
      "command": "node", 
      "args": [
        "<path>/critical-thinking-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation and Running

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the server
node dist/index.js
```

## Example Usage

System prompt:

> Your task is to generate creative, memorable, and marketable product names based on the provided description and keywords. The product names should be concise (2-4 words), evocative, and easily understood by the target audience. Avoid generic or overly literal names. Instead, aim to create a name that stands out, captures the essence of the product, and leaves a lasting impression.

User prompt:

> Description: A noise-canceling, wireless, over-ear headphone with a 20-hour battery life and touch controls. Designed for audiophiles and frequent travelers. Keywords: immersive, comfortable, high-fidelity, long-lasting, convenient

## Best Practices

1. Start with either actor or critic perspective
2. Alternate between perspectives to maintain balance
3. Continue rounds until comprehensive analysis is achieved
4. Focus on relevant performance aspects
5. Generate balanced assessments that honor both perspectives
6. Provide constructive, actionable feedback
7. Only set `nextRoundNeeded` to false when analysis is complete
